    "Unlike buttons, checkbuttons also hold a value. We've seen before how the \"textvariable\" option can be used to tie the label of a widget to a variable in your program; the \"variable\" option for checkbuttons behaves similarly, except it is used to read or change the current value of the widget, and updates whenever the widget is toggled. By default, checkbuttons use a value of \"1\" when the widget is checked, and \"0\" when not checked, but these can be changed to just about anything using the \"onvalue\" and \"offvalue\" options.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens when the linked variable contains neither the on value or the off value (or even doesn't exist)? In that case, the checkbutton is put into a special \"tristate\" or indeterminate mode; you'll sometimes see this in user interfaces where the checkbox holds a single dash rather than being empty or holding a check mark. When in this state, the state flag \"alternate\" is set, so you can check for it with the \"instate\" method:"
