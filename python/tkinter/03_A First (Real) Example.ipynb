The first, \"tkinter\", is the standard binding to Tk, which when loaded also causes the existing Tk library on your system to be loaded. The second, \"ttk\", is Python's binding to the newer \"themed widgets\" that were added to Tk in 8.5.\n",

    "Notice that we've imported everything from the tkinter module, so that we can call tkinter functions etc. without prefixing them, which is standard Tkinter practice. However, because we've imported just \"ttk\" itself, that means we'll need to prefix anything inside that module. For example, calling \"Entry(...)\" would invoke the function inside the tkinter module, while we'd need \"ttk.Entry(...)\" to invoke the function inside ttk. As you'll see, several functions are defined in both modules, and sometimes you will need both, depending on the context. Making the ttk calls explicit facilitates this, and will be the style used in this tutorial.\n",

The \"sticky\" option says how the widget would line up within the grid cell, using compass directions. So \"w\" (west) means anchor the widget to the left side of the cell, \"we\" (west-east) means anchor it to both the left and right sides, and so on."
